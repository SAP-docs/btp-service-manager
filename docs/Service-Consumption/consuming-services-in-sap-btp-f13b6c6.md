# Consuming Services in SAP BTP

To use services in SAP BTP, you creat–µ a service instance, using either the SAP BTP cockpit, or the command-line tools of your runtime platform, for example, the Cloud Foundry environment Command Line Interface \(cf CLI\), and create bindings to retrieve access credentials.

In a Platform-as-a-Service \(PaaS\) environment, all external dependencies, such as databases, messaging and filing systems, are services.

PaaS environments are also services.

In SAP BTP, services are offered in a marketplace, from which users can create service instances on-demand. A service instance is a single instantiation of a service running on SAP BTP.

Service instances are created using a specific service plan. A service plan is a configuration variant of a service. For example, a database can be configured with various plan sizes; each is a different service plan.

To achieve the integration between a service and an application, you must deliver credentials to application. You can use bindings to generate credentials to communicate directly with a service instance.

Some runtime platforms, such as Cloud Foundry, allow binding service instances to your application to automatically deliver the credentials to the application.
