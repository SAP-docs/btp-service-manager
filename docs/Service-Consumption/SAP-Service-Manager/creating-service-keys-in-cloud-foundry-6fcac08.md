# Creating Service Keys in Cloud Foundry

Create service keys so that local or external clients can manually access your service instances.





### Prerequisites

Create a service instance. For more information, see [Creating Service Instances in Cloud Foundry](creating-service-instances-in-cloud-foundry-6d6846d.md).

> 
> -   In the first case, in navigation area, select *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions* after you have chosen your subaccount.
> 
> -   In the second case, navigate first to *Cloud Foundry* \> *Spaces*, and then to *Services* \> *Instances and Subscriptions*
> 
>     .

1.  Select a Cloud Foundry instance for which you want to create a service key.

2.  In the service instance details area that opens to the right, select the Actions menu \(<span class="SAP-icons">î‡²</span>\).

3.  Choose *Create Service Key*.

4.  In the **New Service Key** wizard, choose a name for your service key and provide configuration parameters either by uploading a JSON file or by configuring them in-line.
