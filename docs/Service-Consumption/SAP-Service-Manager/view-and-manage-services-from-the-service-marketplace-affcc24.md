# View and Manage Services from the Service Marketplace

View all offerings you’re entitled to consume in your subaccount and create an instance of a service or an environment and a subscription to an application.



## Overview

In the navigation bar of the SAP BTP cockpit, select *Services*→*Service Marketplace*.

All resources your subaccount is entitled to consume are shown as tiles.

You can view details about a specific resource by selecting one of the tiles.

The details include a short description of a resource, links to the available documentation and support, the plans associated with the resource, its technical name, and the environments for which resource is available.

## Creating Instances or Subscriptions

To consume any of the entitled offerings in your subaccount, you need to create an instance or a subscription.

Use an intuitive wizard that guides you step by step through the procedure.

There are two ways you can access this wizard on the Service Marketplace page:

-   Click on <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Create\) in the top-right corner of a selected tile. A wizard opens.

-   If you’re viewing details of a specific service, click on *Create* in the top-right corner.
