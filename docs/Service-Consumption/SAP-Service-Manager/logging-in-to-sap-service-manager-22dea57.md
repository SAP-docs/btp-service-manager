# Logging in to SAP Service Manager



<a name="loio22dea57deec44d269655ede9a73de653__context_vbv_2br_zmb"/>

## Context

Describes the procedure to access the SAP Service Manager service using the Service Manager Control \(SMCTL\) CLI.



## Procedure

1.  Execute the following command from your Service Manager Control \(SMCTL\) command-line interface:

    ```
    smctl login -a https://service-manager.cfapps.<region domain> --param subdomain=<subdomain>
    ```

    -   To find the `region domain` for the SAP Service Manager, see [Regions and API Endpoints Available for the Cloud Foundry Environment](https://help.sap.com/viewer/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/Cloud/en-US/350356d1dc314d3199dca15bd2ab9b0e.html#loiof344a57233d34199b2123b9620d0bb41).

    -   The `subdomain` is the subaccount subdomain, in which you would like to register the broker. You can find it in the cloud cockpit *Overview* tab of your subaccount.


2.  Input your user, with an assigned *Subaccount Service Administrator* *Role Collection*, and your password.

    > ### Note:  
    > If two-factor authentication \(2FA\) is activated on the SAP Business Technology Platform landscape, then you need to append the passcode generated by the SAP Authenticator to your password.
    > 
    > For example, if your password is `Abcd` and the authenticator-generated passcode is `1234`, enter the password as ***Abcd1234***.
