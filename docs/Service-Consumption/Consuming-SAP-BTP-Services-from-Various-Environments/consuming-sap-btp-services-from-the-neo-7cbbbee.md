# Consuming SAP BTP Services from the Neo Environment

SAP BTP, Neo environment is an enterprise platform-as-a-service \(enterprise PaaS\) that provides comprehensive application development services and capabilities, which lets you build, extend, and integrate business applications in the cloud.

SAP BTP services in the Neo environment don't implement the Open Service Broker API, and therefore aren't managed by SAP Service Manager service.
