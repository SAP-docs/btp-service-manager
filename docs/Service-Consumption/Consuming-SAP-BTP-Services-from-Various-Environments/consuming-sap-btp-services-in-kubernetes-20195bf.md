# Consuming SAP BTP Services in Kubernetes with SAP Service Manager Broker Proxy \(Service Catalog\)

To consume SAP BTP services from your Kubernetes cluster, your cluster must be registered with the SAP Service Manager service in the context of a subaccount. For this, you need a global account and a subaccount, and must be the administrator of the subaccount.

As subaccounts are bound to a specific region, choose or create a subaccount that is closely located to your cluster, to prevent latency drawbacks.
